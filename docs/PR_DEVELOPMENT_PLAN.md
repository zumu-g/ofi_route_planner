## Development Guidelines

### PR Standards
1. **Branch Naming**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`
2. **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits
3. **PR Size**: Keep PRs under 400 lines of changes
4. **Testing**: Include unit tests for new features
5. **Documentation**: Update README and docs for new features

### Code Quality
1. **TypeScript**: Maintain strict type safety
2. **Components**: Keep components small and focused
3. **State Management**: Use React hooks and context appropriately
4. **Performance**: Lazy load heavy components
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Review Process
1. All PRs require at least one review
2. CI/CD must pass (linting, tests, build)
3. Demo new features with screenshots/videos
4. Update changelog with user-facing changes

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Current Technical Debt
1. **Testing Coverage**: Currently minimal test coverage
2. **Component Library**: Consider adopting a UI component library
3. **State Management**: May need Redux/Zustand for complex state
4. **Error Boundaries**: Add comprehensive error handling
5. **Performance**: Optimize bundle size and lazy loading

### Refactoring Priorities
1. Extract reusable hooks
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Add comprehensive TypeScript types
4. Optimize map rendering for many markers
5. Implement service worker for offline support

## Deployment Strategy

### Current
- Manual deployment to static hosting
- Environment variables for API keys

### Future
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Automated deployment to staging/production
   - Environment-based configurations

2. **Monitoring**
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring
   - User analytics

3. **Infrastructure**
   - CDN for static assets
   - API rate limiting
   - Database for user data (Phase 4)

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**
   - Daily/weekly active users
   - Average session duration
   - Routes created per user

2. **Performance**
   - Page load time < 2s
   - Time to interactive < 3s
   - Lighthouse score > 90

3. **Business Impact**
   - User satisfaction (NPS)
   - Feature adoption rates
   - Support ticket volume

## Risks & Mitigation

1. **API Costs**: Geocoding and routing APIs can be expensive
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, rate limiting, usage quotas

2. **Data Privacy**: Location data is sensitive
   - Mitigation: Local-first approach, encryption, clear privacy policy

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Modern features may not work everywhere
   - Mitigation: Progressive enhancement, polyfills, clear requirements

4. **Scalability**: Current architecture may not scale
   - Mitigation: Plan for microservices, caching, CDN from start
